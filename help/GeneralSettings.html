<h2>Breeze icon theme</h2>
<div>
    When checked the application uses the Breeze icon theme.<br>
    When unchecked the application uses the system icon theme. Doesn't always work as expected.<br>
</div>

<h2>Breeze GUI style</h2>
<div>
    When checked this option makes the Qt Quick Controls (buttons, checkboxes etc.) use the Breeze style.<br>
    When unchecked the controls should look according to the system theme. Doesn't always work as expected.<br>
    If the control is disabled (can't be checked/unchecked) it means the Breeze style is not installed.<br>
</div>
