Bugs and feature requests go to [bugs.kde.org](https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Haruna&component=generic)

Describe the bug or feature request as much as possible otherwise the bug/feature request will be closed.

I am done wasting my time with requests/reports that expect me to miraculously know what the user meant,
you want a feature to be added or a bug to be fixed spend some time and do a proper request/report.

Read [Issue Reporting](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/Issue_Reporting) to learn more.
