# Important!

Please note that all bug reports and feature requests should be filed on https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Haruna and should never be raised here.

**:warning: Issues on KDE Invent are solely for tracking ongoing work and intended for use by developers and contributors exclusively.**

We request to consult with a developer or other contributor prior to opening issues here, when in doubt we recommended to open them on https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Haruna instead.

(Please delete this line and the warning text above and below if you create a valid issue.)

**If you submit a bug report or feature request here despite this notice, there's a chance it will be closed without comment or consideration.**
